      <description>How I Studied for AZ-103: Microsoft Azure Administrator Introduction The anecdotal stories I heard from those who had taken the AZ-104 beta is that it was a bit more networking focused than AZ-103. Networking is where I am the weakest. Therefore, I made it a priority to finish up studying and sit for AZ-103 before the exam is retired. Initially, I started from no experience with Azure. I did end up studying for, and passing, AZ-900 before finishing off my AZ-103 studies.</description>

      <description>TechSnips Contributor Shortly after I started participating in the PowerShell user community I had the opportunity to become a contributor at TechSnips.
TechSnips is an IT career development platform that provides free learning content to people in information technology. I think its an interesting concept. Snips are short, 1-10 minute screencasts on a range of technology-related topics like cloud computing, programming, system administration, etc. The primary difference from other video learning formats, there is absolutely no fluff.</description>
