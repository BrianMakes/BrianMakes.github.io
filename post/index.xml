      <description>Study Guide - Migrating Email to Microsoft 365 When I was studying to complete my MCSA: Office 365 in 2018, I struggled a bit keeping the multiple migration options straight. I needed to work through the material again anyway, maybe my notes will help others that are studying.
I worked through the Exchange Online Docs and made a few notes.
Migration Types Most of the study material for MS-100 talks about four primary migration methods: Staged, Cutover, Hybrid and IMAP.</description>

      <description>Why did I decided to take MS-900 Microsoft 365 Fundamentals Introduction Microsoft moved to Role-Based Certifications, and I was slow to adapt. In 2018 I passed the exams for the MCSA: Office 365 and MCSE: Productivity. The current global pandemic left me stuck at home and in need of distraction. I decided this was the year to bring my Microsoft Certifications up to date. So, while Microsoft 365 Fundamentals is not a prerequisite for the Enterprise Administrator Expert certification, I decided to take it anyway.</description>

      <description>How I Studied for AZ-103: Microsoft Azure Administrator Introduction The anecdotal stories I heard from those who had taken the AZ-104 beta is that it was a bit more networking focused than AZ-103. Networking is where I am the weakest. Therefore, I made it a priority to finish up studying and sit for AZ-103 before the exam is retired. Initially, I started from no experience with Azure. I did end up studying for, and passing, AZ-900 before finishing off my AZ-103 studies.</description>

      <description>TechSnips Contributor Shortly after I started participating in the PowerShell user community I had the opportunity to become a contributor at TechSnips.
TechSnips is an IT career development platform that provides free learning content to people in information technology. I think its an interesting concept. Snips are short, 1-10 minute screencasts on a range of technology-related topics like cloud computing, programming, system administration, etc. The primary difference from other video learning formats, there is absolutely no fluff.</description>
