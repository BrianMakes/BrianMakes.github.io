      <description>Study Guide - Migrating Email to Microsoft 365 When I was studying to complete my MCSA: Office 365 in 2018, I struggled a bit keeping the multiple migration options straight. I needed to work through the material again anyway, maybe my notes will help others that are studying.
I worked through the Exchange Online Docs and made a few notes.
Migration Types Most of the study material for MS-100 talks about four primary migration methods: Staged, Cutover, Hybrid and IMAP.</description>

      <description>Why did I decided to take MS-900 Microsoft 365 Fundamentals Introduction Microsoft moved to Role-Based Certifications, and I was slow to adapt. In 2018 I passed the exams for the MCSA: Office 365 and MCSE: Productivity. The current global pandemic left me stuck at home and in need of distraction. I decided this was the year to bring my Microsoft Certifications up to date. So, while Microsoft 365 Fundamentals is not a prerequisite for the Enterprise Administrator Expert certification, I decided to take it anyway.</description>
