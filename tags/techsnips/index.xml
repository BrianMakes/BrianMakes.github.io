      <description>TechSnips Contributor Shortly after I started participating in the PowerShell user community I had the opportunity to become a contributor at TechSnips.
TechSnips is an IT career development platform that provides free learning content to people in information technology. I think its an interesting concept. Snips are short, 1-10 minute screencasts on a range of technology-related topics like cloud computing, programming, system administration, etc. The primary difference from other video learning formats, there is absolutely no fluff.</description>
